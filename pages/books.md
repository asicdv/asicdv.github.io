Although I am not a avid reader but I like to read self-help, inspirational, non-fiction, biographies books. 

- Cultivate good reading habit.
- Read books you like again and again.
- Dont want to go into reading challenge, 12 books in a year challenge.
- No matter how lonely you are, when you read a book you dive into the imagination of the authors idea.
